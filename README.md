# Grape-Variety-Encyclopedia
After an incredible Code In Place journey with Chris, Mehran, Jerry, and the CIP team, this shall become my final project to complete the course.

A big thank you to everyone for the new knowledge I could gain :-) Check out https://codeinplace.stanford.edu/ for more info about CIP.

The scope of the project is to create a small working model of a wine grape database as an encyclopedia.

Targets are:

- Importing grape facts from a CSV file (data was handpicked from https://winefolly.com/)
- Provide images from a local directory (grape images taken from http://wikipedia.com/)
- Find a way to make things look „easily“ good > https://streamlit.io/
- Optional features: search function, filters
